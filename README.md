# Mapping_Earthquakes

The purpose of this module and challenge was to continue our practice with javascript, html, and d3 and also learn how to use mapbox. We also learned how to create and merge new branches, which was something I had not done before. 

This module focused on mapping earthquakes on a mapbox html file. We had the chance to play around with different styles of maps, create geojson points, create linestrings, build in legends, and much more! I really enjoyed learning how to add layers to the maps and allow the user to toggle between different views in the html file.

Our final assignment was to take data on both major earthquakes and tectonic plates and create different layers of maps in our file.
